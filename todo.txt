model:
    train should take dataset.
    how to divide data into validation, test, train? where?
dataset:
    dataset should not do any label transformation. delegate this to model.
    dataset should return unique labels so that model can fit labelencoder immediately.
    actually couldn't decide where the label encoding should be. not sure which one is effective. I should check more examples.
